//    // EDUCATIONAL COMMENT: Nullable types in Kotlin
//    // The '?' after String makes these properties nullable (can hold null values)
//    // This is Kotlin's way of handling null safety - you must explicitly declare when a variable can be null
//    var employeeName: String? = null
//    var employeeType: String? = null // fulltime, intern, contractor
//
//    // EDUCATIONAL COMMENT: Non-nullable integer property with default value
//    // Since there's no '?' this property cannot be null and is initialized to 0
//    var employeeId = 0
//
//}

// EDUCATIONAL COMMENT: This entire class is commented out, demonstrating how to temporarily disable code
// Commenting out code is useful during development when you want to:
// 1. Test different implementations
// 2. Temporarily remove functionality without deleting it
// 3. Keep reference code for future use
// In production code, commented-out sections should generally be removed
